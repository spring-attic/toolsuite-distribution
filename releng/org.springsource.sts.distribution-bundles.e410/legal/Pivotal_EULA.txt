PIVOTAL SOFTWARE
END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
This End User License Agreement (“EULA”) is an agreement to license Software 
between Licensee and Pivotal (meaning (i) Pivotal Software, Inc., if Licensee 
is located in the United States; and (ii) the local Pivotal sales subsidiary, 
if Licensee is located in a country outside the United States in which Pivotal 
has a local sales subsidiary; and (iii) Pivotal Software International (subject 
to Section 11 below), if Licensee is located in a country outside the United 
States in which Pivotal does not have a local sales subsidiary (in each case, 
referred to herein as “Pivotal”). Unless otherwise set forth in a signed 
agreement between Pivotal (or its Distributor) and Licensee, by downloading, 
installing or using Software, Licensee is agreeing to these terms.

1. EVALUATION LICENSE. If Licensee is licensing Software as Evaluation Software 
and/or as Beta Components, then such use is solely for use in a non-production 
environment for the Evaluation Period. Notwithstanding any other provision in 
this EULA, Evaluation Software and Beta Components are provided “AS-IS” without 
indemnification, support, or warranty of any kind, expressed or implied. All 
such licenses expire at the earlier of the end of the Evaluation Period or upon 
return of the Evaluation Software.

2. LICENSE GRANT

2.1. License Grant. Pivotal grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable 
license, without rights to sublicense, to use Software and Documentation, and 
related Support Services, up to the maximum licensed capacity during the period 
identified in the Quote, in the Territory, and subject to the Guide, for 
internal business operations only. Should Licensee exceed the licensed 
capacity, it will promptly procure additional license rights at a mutually 
agreed price. Third Party Agents may access Software on Licensee’s behalf 
during the applicable period solely for Licensee’s internal business 
operations. Licensee may make 1 unmodified backup copy of Software solely for 
archival purposes. If Licensee upgrades or exchanges Software from a previous 
validly licensed version, Licensee must cease using all prior Software versions 
and certify same to Pivotal. Licensee is responsible for obtaining any 
software, hardware or other technology required to operate Software and 
complying with any corresponding terms and conditions.

2.2. License Restrictions. Licensee must not, and must not allow any third 
party to: (a) use Software in an application services provider, service bureau, 
or similar capacity; (b) disclose to any third party the results of any 
benchmark testing or comparative or competitive analyses of Software without 
Pivotal’s prior written approval; (c) except as otherwise expressly permitted 
by Pivotal, make Software available for access or use to any third party; (d) 
transfer or sublicense Software or Documentation (other than to an Affiliate, 
subject to Pivotal’s prior written approval); (e) use Software in conflict with 
the Guide, Quote and/or Order; (f) except as permitted by applicable mandatory 
law or third party license, modify, translate, enhance, or create derivative 
works from Software, or reverse assemble or disassemble, reverse engineer, 
decompile (subject to Section 2.5), or otherwise attempt to derive source code 
from Software; (g) remove any copyright or other proprietary notices on or in 
Software; or (h) violate or circumvent any technological restrictions within 
Software or as otherwise specified in this EULA.

2.3. Open Source Software. OSS is licensed to Licensee under the applicable OSS 
license terms (a) located in the open_source_licenses.txt file included in or 
along with Software, Evaluation Software, or the corresponding source files 
available at https://www.pivotal.io/open-source or https://network.pivotal.io, 
and/or (b) available by sending a written request, with Licensee’s name and 
address, to: Pivotal Software, Inc., Open Source Files Request, Attn: General 
Counsel, 3495 Deer Creek Road, Palo Alto, CA 94903. This offer to obtain a copy 
of the licenses/source files is valid for 3 years from the date Licensee first 
acquired access to Software. Licensee is responsible for complying with all 
applicable OSS terms and conditions, which shall take precedence over this 
EULA, solely with respect to such OSS.

2.4. Subscription License. If a Quote or Order indicates a Subscription 
License, then the terms in this Section 2.4 shall also apply. At least 60 days 
before expiration of the Subscription Period, Pivotal will notify Licensee of 
its option to renew for 1 additional year at the same annual rate in the Quote 
or Order. Licensee’s Subscription License shall automatically renew at the end 
of the Subscription Period for 1 additional year at the same annual rate stated 
in the Quote or Order if Licensee does not notify Pivotal at least 30 days 
before expiration of the Subscription Period of Licensee’s intent not to renew. 
Upon such notification, Licensee agrees to cease using Software at the 
expiration of the Subscription Period and will certify cessation of use to 
Pivotal.

2.5. Decompilation. If applicable laws in the Territory grant an express right 
to decompile Software to render it interoperable with other software, Licensee 
may decompile Software, but must first request Pivotal to do so, providing all 
requested information to allow Pivotal to assess the request. Pivotal may, in 
its discretion, provide such interoperability information, impose reasonable 
conditions, including a reasonable fee, on such use of Software, or offer to 
provide alternatives to protect Pivotal’s proprietary rights therein.

2.6. Reserved Rights. Pivotal retains all right, title, and interest in and to 
Software and Documentation, all related intellectual property rights, and all 
rights not expressly granted to Licensee in this EULA.

3. ORDERS. Licensee’s Order is subject to this EULA. No Orders are binding 
until accepted by Pivotal. Orders for Software are deemed accepted upon 
Pivotal’s delivery of Software included in such Order. Orders issued to Pivotal 
do not have to be signed to be valid and enforceable. Licensee shall pay in 
full in accordance with Pivotal’s invoice. Orders for Subscription Licenses are 
non-cancelable and non-refundable.

4. WARRANTY/DISCLAIMER. Pivotal warrants to Licensee that Software will, for 
the Warranty Period, substantially conform to the applicable Documentation, 
provided such Software: (a) has been properly installed and used in accordance 
with the Documentation; and (b) has not been modified by persons other than 
Pivotal. For any breach of this warranty, Pivotal will, at its option and 
expense, and as Licensee’s exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, 
either replace that Software or correct any reproducible error in that Software 
reported to Pivotal by Licensee in writing during the Warranty Period. If 
Pivotal determines that it is unable to replace that Software or correct that 
error, Pivotal will refund to Licensee the amount paid by Licensee for that 
Software, and the license will terminate. OTHER THAN THE WARRANTY ABOVE, AND TO 
THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PIVOTAL AND ITS DISTRIBUTORS 
MAKE NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY STATUTE, OPERATION OF LAW, COURSE OF DEALING OR 
PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. PIVOTAL AND ITS DISTRIBUTORS DO NOT WARRANT 
THAT SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED, THAT IT WILL BE FREE FROM DEFECTS OR 
THAT IT WILL MEET LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS.

5. INDEMNITY

5.1. Defense and Indemnity. Subject to the remainder of this Section 5 and 
Section 6 of this EULA, Pivotal shall (a) defend Licensee against any Claim 
that Software infringes a copyright or patent enforceable in a Berne Convention 
signatory country; and (b) pay resulting costs and damages finally awarded 
against Licensee by a court of competent jurisdiction, or pay amounts stated in 
a written settlement negotiated and approved by Pivotal. The foregoing 
obligations apply only if Licensee (i) promptly notifies Pivotal in writing of 
such Claim; (ii) grants Pivotal sole control over defense and settlement; (iii) 
reasonably cooperates in response to Pivotal’s request for assistance; (iv) is 
not in material breach of this EULA; and (v) is current in payment of all 
applicable fees prior to a Claim.

5.2. Remedies. If the allegedly infringing Software is held to constitute an 
infringement, or in Pivotal’s opinion, Software is likely to become infringing 
and its use enjoined, Pivotal may, at its sole option and expense: (a) procure 
for Licensee the right to make continued use of the affected Software; (b) 
replace or modify the affected Software to make it non-infringing; or (c) 
notify Licensee to return the affected Software and, upon receipt, discontinue 
the related support services and, for Subscription Licenses, refund unused 
prepaid fees calculated based on each month remaining in the period identified 
in the Quote or Order.

5.3. Exclusions. Neither Pivotal nor any Distributor shall have any obligation 
under this Section 5 or otherwise with respect to any infringement Claim that 
arises out of or relates to: (a) combination, operation or use of Software with 
any other software, hardware, technology, data, or other materials, if the 
infringement would not have arisen but for such combination, operation or use; 
(b) use for a purpose or in a manner for which Software was not designed or use 
after Pivotal notifies Licensee to cease such use due to a possible or pending 
infringement Claim; (c) any modifications to Software made by any person other 
than Pivotal or its authorized representatives; (d) any modifications to 
Software made by Pivotal pursuant to instructions, designs, specifications, or 
any other information provided to Pivotal by or on behalf of Licensee; (e) use 
of any version of Software when an upgrade or a newer iteration of Software 
made available by Pivotal could have avoided the infringement; (f) any data or 
information which Licensee or a third party utilizes in connection with 
Software; or (g) any Open Source Software. THIS SECTION 5 STATES LICENSEE’S 
SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND PIVOTAL’S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT 
CLAIMS.

6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT MANDATED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT 
SHALL PIVOTAL OR ITS DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS 
OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS 
INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, 
TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE. PIVOTAL’S AND ITS 
DISTRIBUTORS’ LIABILITY UNDER THIS EULA SHALL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED THE 
LESSER OF (A) FEES LICENSEE PAID FOR SOFTWARE DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING 
THE DATE PIVOTAL RECEIVES WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE FIRST CLAIM TO ARISE UNDER THIS 
EULA; OR (B) USD $1,000,000. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS 
OF WHETHER PIVOTAL OR ITS DISTRIBUTORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL 
PURPOSE. LICENSEE MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM UNDER THIS EULA MORE THAN 18 MONTHS 
AFTER (i) THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, FOR SUBSCRIPTION LICENSES, AND 
(ii) THE CLAIM FIRST ARISES FOR PERPETUAL LICENSES.

7. TERMINATION. Pivotal may terminate this EULA effective immediately upon 
written notice to Licensee if: (a) Licensee fails to pay any portion of fees 
due under an applicable Quote and/or Order within 10 days after receiving 
notice that payment is past due; (b) Licensee suffers an insolvency or 
analogous event; (c) Licensee commits a material breach of this EULA that is 
incapable of being cured; or (d) Licensee breaches any other provision of this 
EULA and does not cure the breach within 30 days after receiving written notice 
of breach. If the EULA expires or terminates, Licensee must remove and destroy 
all copies of Software, including all backup copies, from the server, virtual 
machine, and all computers and terminals on which Software (including copies) 
is installed or used and certify destruction thereof. Pivotal may also 
terminate this EULA for convenience by giving 3 month’s written notice to 
Licensee. All provisions of this EULA will survive any termination or 
expiration if by its nature and context it is intended to survive.

8. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each party shall (a) use the other party’s Confidential 
Information only for exercising rights and performing obligations in connection 
with this EULA; and (b) protect from disclosure any Confidential Information 
disclosed by the other party for a period commencing upon the disclosure date 
until 3 years thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may 
disclose Confidential Information: (i) to an Affiliate to fulfill its 
obligations or exercise its rights under this EULA so long as such Affiliate 
agrees to comply with these restrictions in writing; and (ii) if required by 
law or regulatory authorities provided the receiving party has given the 
disclosing party prompt notice before disclosure. Pivotal shall not be 
responsible for unauthorized disclosure of Licensee’s data stored within 
Software arising from a data security breach. Licensee is solely responsible 
for all obligations to comply with laws applicable to Licensee’s Software use, 
including without limitation any personal data processing. Pivotal may collect, 
use, store and transmit technical and related information about Licensee’s 
Software use, including server internet protocol address, hardware 
identification, operating system, application software, peripheral hardware, 
and Software usage statistics, to facilitate the provisioning of updates, 
support, invoicing, and online services. Licensee is responsible for obtaining 
all consents required to enable Pivotal to exercise its confidentiality rights, 
in compliance with applicable law.

9. RECORDS/AUDIT. For the period set forth in the Quote and/or Order, any 
renewals, and for 3 years thereafter, Licensee shall maintain accurate records 
regarding its compliance with this EULA. Upon reasonable notice (and no more 
than once per year), Pivotal may audit Licensee’s Software use to determine 
such compliance and payment of fees. Licensee will promptly pay additional fees 
identified by the audit and reimburse Pivotal for all audit costs if it 
discloses underpayment by more than 5% in the audited period, or that Licensee 
breached any EULA term.

10. GENERAL. This EULA is governed by California law. Each Party hereby 
expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction of either the California courts 
or the United States District Courts located in the State of California and 
agrees that any action relating to or arising out of this EULA be instituted 
and prosecuted only in the Superior Court of the County of San Francisco or the 
United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The U.N. 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. 
Software and Support Services are subject to U.S., European Union and other 
export and import laws and regulations. Both parties shall comply with all 
applicable laws and regulations and diversion contrary to such laws is 
expressly prohibited. Except to the extent expressly set forth to the contrary 
in this EULA, this EULA is not intended to confer upon any person other than 
the parties hereto any rights or remedies. The parties are independent 
contractors. This EULA is the complete statement of the parties’ agreement with 
regard to the subject matter hereof and may be modified only by written 
agreement. Licensee shall not assign or transfer any rights under this EULA or 
delegate any of its duties hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without 
Pivotal’s prior written consent, and any such action in violation of this 
provision, is null and void, and of no force, and a breach of this EULA. 
Pivotal may assign or transfer this EULA to any successors-in-interest to all 
or substantially all of the business or assets of Pivotal whether by merger, 
reorganization, asset sale or otherwise, or to any Affiliates of Pivotal, and 
this EULA shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the respective 
permitted successors and assigns. Pivotal may use Pivotal Affiliates or other 
sufficiently qualified subcontractors to provide Support Services, provided 
that Pivotal remains responsible for performance thereof. If any part of this 
EULA, an Order, or a Quote is held unenforceable, the validity of the remaining 
provisions shall not be affected. In the event of conflict or inconsistency 
among the Guide, this EULA and the Order, the following order of precedence 
shall apply: (a) the Guide, (b) this EULA and (c) the Order.

11. COUNTRY SPECIFIC TERMS [INTERNATIONAL]. The terms in this Section 11 apply

flood, fire, power loss, denial of access or air crash) and affect the 
availability of data at the impacted site;
